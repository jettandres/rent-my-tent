# Introducing
**Rent My Tent** brings people who can no longer erect their own tent to share it with others who need it.

# Purpose
To discourage the purchasing of tents as one-time use only and thereby reducing our carbon footprint.

# System Overview
Once a tent is added to the marketplace it will always be available for rent; except during rental periods when the tent is being used by the renter

Tents are rented from one owner to another and are listed back automatically by the borrower to the marketplace after its rental period. 

# Reasoning
Often people purchase tents with only a single-use in mind. This means we have many tents, yet little utility.

In the UK its a particular problem at music festivals where [250,000 tents get left behind every year](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/festivals-2019-tent-ban-single-use-plastic-waste-pollution-aif-a8904216.html). This becomes nearly 900 tonnes of plastic waste, most of which ends up in landfill.

Tents are multi-material - nylon, metal, plastic etc., so practically impossible to recycle. The average tent weighs 3.5kg and is mostly made of plastic - the equivalent of 8750 straws.

# Future Development
Transactions are currently being done using [Celo](https://celo.org/) currency.

We plan on leveraging [deposit return scheme](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/deposit-return-schemes-what-exactly-are-they/) to keep the market for tents ongoing.

Tents will also be represented as [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) to encourage more owners to post.

# Screens
